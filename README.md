This README outlines the framework and methodologies for conducting time travel-related experiments grounded in chemistry and physics principles.

## Introduction
Time travel experiments are grounded in the interplay between relativity, quantum mechanics, and chemical energy transformations. By leveraging the principles of physics (relativity, particle dynamics) and chemistry (energy conversion, reactions), these experiments aim to simulate or understand time dilation and energy requirements for near-light-speed travel.

### 2. **Quantum Entanglement and Time Symmetry**
#### Objective:
Explore the implications of quantum entanglement on non-linear time relationships.

#### Methodology:
- Use entangled particles to test instantaneous state changes across distances.
- Investigate quantum time symmetry and retrocausal effects.

#### Requirements:
- Quantum computer or entanglement generator.
- Measurement devices for observing entanglement and state changes.

#### Outcome:
